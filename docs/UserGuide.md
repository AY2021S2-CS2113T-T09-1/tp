#User Guide for Control Your Crowd (CYC)

## Introduction

Control Your Crowd (CYC) is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application for the venue management team to manage crowd
levels in real time. It allows efficient tracking and accessing of visitor's profiles with ease. You can easily checkin
and checkout a visitor, get current crowd level, limit the venue capacity, save the data for future references and much
more. If you can type fast, CYC can enable you to manage the crowd faster than traditional Graphical User Interface 
(GUI) applications.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer.
2. Download the latest version of `ControlYourCrowd.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2113T-T09-1/tp/releases).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your CYC.
4. Open up a command window to the location where your `ControlYourCrowd.jar` is located.
5. Run the command `java -jar [venue name] [venue maximum capacity] ControlYourCrowd.jar`. For example, 
   `java -jar NUS 1000 ControlYourCrowd.jar`.
6. If the setup is correct, you should see CYC being loaded as shown below.
    ```

   ```
7. Input the command in the command window and press Enter to execute it. Refer to [Features](UserGuide.md#features)
   for details of each command.

## Features 

Notes about the command format:
* Commands are in `lower_case`
* Items in square brackets `[ ]` are optional.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by user.
    * E.g. in `checkin n/NAME i/LAST_4_CHARS_OF_ID`, `NAME` is a parameter that has to be supplied by user. So e.g. `checkin n/John i/123A`
* Additional parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, `clear`) will be ignored.
e.g if the user types `help 123`, it will be intepreted as `help`.
