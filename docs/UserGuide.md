## Introduction

Welcome to the User Guide of **Control Your Crowd**!

Our application, Control Your Crowd (CYC), will allow you to manage your crowds in real time. It allows efficient
tracking and accessing of visitors' profiles. You can also easily check in and check out a visitor, get current crowd level,
limit the venue capacity, save the visitor log for future references and much more! CYC is an all-in-one application to
help you manage your crowd levels at any venue with ease.

The application uses a Command Line Interface (CLI); this means that you operate the application by typing commands into
a command window. If you can type fast, CYC can enable you to manage the crowd faster than other traditional Graphical User
Interface (GUI) applications; GUI applications allow user to interact with the application through graphical icons such
as buttons.

If you are interested, jump to [Quick Start](UserGuide.md#quick-start) to learn how to start managing your crowd using
CYC.

## Quick Start

> Prerequisites:
> * Ensure that you have **Java 11** or above installed in your Computer. If you do not have, you can get it from
>   [here](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

1. Download the latest version of `ControlYourCrowd.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2113T-T09-1/tp/releases).
2. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your CYC.
3. Open up a command window to the location where your `ControlYourCrowd.jar` is located.
4. Run the command `java -jar [venue name] [venue maximum capacity] ControlYourCrowd.jar`. For example, 
   `java -jar NUS 500 ControlYourCrowd.jar`.
   * Ensure that the venue maximum capacity entered is a positive integer that does not exceed 6 digits.
5. If the setup is correct, you should see CYC being loaded as shown below (note: your version of CYC would be the 
   latest version).

6. Input the command in the command window and press Enter to execute it. Refer to [Features](UserGuide.md#features)
   for details of each command.

## Features 

> Notes about the command format:
> * Commands are in `lower_case`.
> * Items in square brackets `[ ]` are optional.
> * Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by user.
>    * E.g. in `checkin n/NAME i/LAST_4_CHARS_OF_ID`, `NAME` is a parameter that has to be supplied by user. So e.g. `checkin n/John i/123A`.
> * Additional parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, `clear`) will be ignored.
>   * e.g. if the user types `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
> * `i/LAST_4_CHARS_OF_ID` is unique. (i.e. no two persons will have the same ID)

### Viewing help: `help`

This command will provide you a summary of the all the commands with its corresponding format. This command will help
you in situations when you forget the available commands, or their format while on duty.

#### Format: `help`

#### Example Input: `help`

#### Example Output:

![help](images/help.png)

### Check-in a person: `checkin`

This command allows you to check in and add a person to the CYC. It will also notify you on the current venue capacity.

#### Format: 
`checkin i/LAST_4_CHARS_OF_ID [n/NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER]`
* First 3 characters of `LAST_4_CHARS_OF_ID` should be integers.  Last character of `LAST_4_CHARS_OF_ID` must be in `CAPS`.
* `NAME` is optional. If the user has checked in before, entering the `LAST_4_CHARS_OF_ID` is sufficient to retrieve the user's `NAME` and `PHONE_NUMBER` 
  from previous check in. **If the user has not checked in before, `NAME` must be entered.**
* `NAME` must only contain english alphabet letters and empty spaces with a maximum character limit of 30. Any other characters will not be accepted.
* `PHONE_NUMBER` is optional. `PHONE_NUMBER` must consist of 8 integers, as per local (Singapore) phone number format.

#### Example Input: 
Suppose a new visitor, John wants to check in. Since it is his first time visiting, you should check in John using his
`i/LAST_4_CHARS_OF_ID`, `n/NAME` and `[p/PHONE_NUMBER]` as shown below.

`checkin i/123A n/John p/91231112`

After that, the next time John wants to check in, you only need to check in using his `i/LAST_4_CHARS_OF_ID` as shown below.

`checkin i/123A`

#### Example Output:
For both new visitor and returning visitor, you should observe the following output.

![exit](images/exit_success.png)

### Visitor Log

CYC automatically saves the details of previous persons.

A person who have checked in before, does not have to input all his details again when using the `checkin` command.

The person details are stored in `/LogFile.txt` in the same folder as the program.

### Saving data
The program automatically saves data to a `.txt` file after each command you input.
The program defaults to saving to `/TrackingList.txt` in the same folder as the program.

### Changing save location
To change the save location, you can use the command `movestorage`

### History

CYC automatically keeps a back up of the checkin and checkout history as CSV, comma separated values.

Users, such as event organiser or mall owners, could therefore study these data for future planning and necessary
upgrade of facilities.

### Saving history
The program automatically saves the history to 'history.txt' file after each checkin and checkout operation.

### Clearing history
To clear history, please follow the following steps:
1. Exit CYC.
2. Locate the directory of CYC on the computer.
3. Locate `/History.txt` and delete the file directly. 
   (CYC will start a new History file upon a restart.)

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer? 

**A**: Please follow these steps:
1. Follow the [Quick Start](UserGuide.md#quick-start) guide and install CYC on the computer
2. Transfer the `/History.txt`,`/LogFile.txt` and `/TrackingList.txt` to the target computer's main CYC folder.
